**Part 1:**
- Command used to create new directory (ebooks): $ mkdir ebooks/

- Command used to download the ebook from given link and name it "hamlet.txt" : $ curl <link> -o hamlet.txt
        - Output: Snapshot of Average Dload, Speed Upload, Time total etc


**Part 2:**
- Command used to change the current working directory: $ cd /usr/lib

- Command used to display size and permission (absolute path): $ ls -l ~/ebooks/hamlet.txt
        - Output: Permissions and size in bytes as requried= -rw-rw-r--+ 1 ssri0026 Domain Users 184406 Mar 21 22:07 /home/ssri0026/ebooks/hamlet.txt 
 #The common directory for ~/ebooks (home) and /usr/lib (usr) is the root directory itself. Therefore: 

- Command used to change current working directory to "/": $ cd /

- Command used to display size and permission (relative to root directory): $ ls -l ~/ebooks/hamlet.txt
	- Output: Permissions and size in bytes as required= -rw-rw-r--+ 1 ssri0026 Domain Users 184406 Mar 22 17:35 /hamlet.txt
	- The paths are the same in this case as the common directory is the root directory.  

- (For Part 3 checking)
	- Command used to store the number of bytes into bytes.txt: $ echo "184406" > bytes.txt)



**Part 3:**
- Command used to print number of lines, words, bytes: $ wc ~/ebooks/hamlet.txt
        - Output: 5307 32252 184406 /home/ssri0026/ebooks/hamlet.txt

- Command used to store the number of bytes into bytes_compare.txt: $ echo "184406" > bytes_compare.txt

- Command used to compare and check if the number of bytes are the same in Part 2 and 3: $ diff bytes.txt bytes_compare.txt 
	- Output: Indicates that both files are an exact match and the number of bytes obtained in task 3 = task 2. 
#NOTE: Check through the above method is rather tedious as the number of bytes can be compared visually. 



**Part 4:**
- Command used to output line #3447: $ head -3447 ~/ebooks/hamlet.txt|tail -1
        - Output: Is thought-sicke at the act


**Part 5:**
- Command used to count the number of lines in which "hamlet" appears: $ grep hamlet ~/ebooks/hamlet.txt|wc
        -Output: 0    0    0
- Command used to count the number of lines in which "**H**amlet" appears: $ grep Hamlet ~/ebooks/hamlet.txt|wc
        - Output: 108  694  4226
